# ELK Stack Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the configuration and implementation of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack used in our project for log management, analysis, and visualization.

## Technologies Used

### Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases:
- **Real-time document store**: Store and retrieve documents in a distributed manner
- **Search engine**: Fast full-text search capabilities
- **Analytics engine**: Real-time analysis of data with complex aggregations

### Logstash
Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to Elasticsearch:
- **Data collection**: Ingests data from various sources
- **Filtering**: Transforms and structures data
- **Output**: Sends processed data to Elasticsearch

### Kibana
Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch:
- **Dashboard creation**: Build custom dashboards for data visualization
- **Data exploration**: Analyze and explore data through charts, graphs, and maps
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Configuration
The configuration files in this directory define how these components interact:
- Elasticsearch configuration: Cluster settings, node roles, memory allocation
- Logstash configuration: Input plugins, filters, and output destinations
- Kibana configuration: Server settings, Elasticsearch connection

## Usage
1. Start the ELK stack using Docker <!--Compose: `docker-compose up -d` -->
2. Access Kibana at `http://localhost:5601`
3. Configure Logstash data inputs as needed
4. Create visualizations and dashboards in Kibana

## Troubleshooting
- Check Elasticsearch logs: `docker logs <elasticsearch-container-name>`
- Verify Logstash pipeline: `docker logs <logstash-container-name>`
- Ensure proper connectivity between services
